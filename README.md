# Jupyter-Notebook
These are a few reference notebooks for analysis, and some of the code
associated with them. Everything (for now) is set up to run locally, but ideally
things will scale to eventually run on the BU shared clusters on the Holyoak
 supercomputers.


Notebooks are mostly in python, though there are a few in matlab.


### Dependancies
The Python dependencies are: Anaconda, Thunder (Freeman Lab, dev branch (0.6.0)), Lightning (Freeman Lab), and Seaborn.
